</rdfs:Class>

<rdfs:Class rdf:ID= "ChemicalProcess">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource ="#InternalChange"/>
<rdfs:comment>A ChemicalProcess occurs whenever 
chemical compounds (CompoundSubstances) are formed or decomposed.  
For example, reactants disappear as chemical change occurs, and products 
appear as chemical change occurs.  In a chemical change a chemical 
reaction takes place.  Catalysts in a ChemicalProcess may speed up the 
reaction, but aren't themselves produced or consumed.  Examples: rusting of 
iron and the decomposition of water, induced by an electric current, to 
gaseous hydrogen and gaseous oxygen.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:Class rdf:ID= "Class">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource ="#SetOrClass"/>
<rdfs:comment>Classes differ from Sets in three important respects.  
First, Classes are not assumed to be extensional.  That is, distinct 
Classes might well have exactly the same instances.  Second, Classes typically 
have an associated `condition' that determines the instances of the Class.  So, 
for example, the condition `human' determines the Class of Humans.  Note that 
some Classes might satisfy their own condition (e.g., the Class of Abstract 
things is Abstract) and hence be instances of themselves.  Third, the instances 
of a class may occur only once within the class, i.e. a class cannot contain 
duplicate instances.</rdfs:comment>

chimpanzees, gorillas, dolphins, whales, and some extraterrestrials 
(if they exist) may be CognitiveAgents.</rdfs:comment>

is different from Attaching in that the former results in one of the objects 
being part of the other, while Attaching only results in the two objects 
being connected with one another.  Note too that Combining is different 
from Putting in that one or both of the two things which are combined may or 
may not be moved from the location where they were combined.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The Class of Substances that contain 
two or more elements (ElementalSubstances), in definite proportion by weight. 
The composition of a pure compound will be invariant, regardless of the method 
of preparation. Compounds are composed of more than one kind of atom (element). 
The term molecule is often used for the smallest unit of a compound that still 
retains all of the properties of the compound.  Examples: Table salt (sodium 
chloride, NaCl), sugar (sucrose, C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}), and water (H_2O). </rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:Class rdf:ID= "ConstantQuantity">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource ="#PhysicalQuantity"/>
<rdfs:comment>A ConstantQuantity is a 
PhysicalQuantity which has a constant value, e.g. 3 meters and 5 hours.  
The magnitude (see MagnitudeFn) of every ConstantQuantity is a 
RealNumber.  ConstantQuantities are distinguished from 
FunctionQuantities, which map ConstantQuantities to other 
ConstantQuantities.  All ConstantQuantites are expressed with the 
BinaryFunction MeasureFn, which takes a Number and a UnitOfMeasure 
as arguments.  For example, 3 Meters can be expressed as (MeasureFn 3 
Meter).  ConstantQuantities form a partial order (see 
PartialOrderingRelation) with the lessThan relation, since lessThan 
is a RelationExtendedToQuantities and lessThan is defined over the 
RealNumbers.  The lessThan relation is not a total order (see 
TotalOrderingRelation) over the class ConstantQuantity since elements 
of some subclasses of ConstantQuantity (such as length quantities) 
are incomparable to elements of other subclasses of ConstantQuantity 
(such as mass quantities).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:Class rdf:ID= "EngineeringComponent">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource ="#Device"/>
<rdfs:comment>A fundamental concept that applies 
in many engineering domains.  An EngineeringComponent is an element of 
a Device that is a physically whole object, such as one might 
see listed as standard parts in a catalog.  The main difference betweeen 
EngineeringComponents and arbitrary globs of matter is that 
EngineeringComponents are object-like in a modeling sense.  Thus, an 
EngineeringComponent is not an arbtrary subregion, but a part of a 
system with a stable identity.</rdfs:comment>
</rdfs:Class>

<rdfs:Class rdf:ID= "EngineeringConnection">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource ="#EngineeringComponent"/>
<rdfs:comment>An EngineeringConnection is an 
EngineeringComponent that represents a connection relationship between 
two other EngineeringComponents.  It is a reification of the 
Predicate connectedEngineeringComponents.  That means that whenever 
this Predicate holds between two EngineeringComponents, there exists an 
EngineeringConnection.  The practical reason for reifying a relationship 
is to be able to attach other information about it. For example, one
might want to say that a particular connection is associated with some 
openllet.shared.hash parameters, or that it is of a particular type.  
EngineeringConnections are EngineeringComponents and can therefore be 
an engineeringSubcomponent of other EngineeringComponents.  However, 
to provide for modular regularity in component systems, 
EngineeringConnections cannot be connected.  For each pair of 
EngineeringComponents related by connectedEngineeringComponents, there 
exists at least one EngineeringConnection.  However, that object may not 
be unique, and the same EngineeringConnection may be associated with 
several pairs of EngineeringComponents.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:Class rdf:ID= "PhysicalQuantity">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource ="#Quantity"/>
<rdfs:comment>A PhysicalQuantity is a measure of 
some quantifiable aspect of the modeled world, such as 'the earth's 
diameter' (a constant length) and 'the stress in a loaded deformable 
solid' (a measure of stress, which is a function of three spatial 
coordinates).  All PhysicalQuantities are either ConstantQuantities 
or FunctionQuantities.  Instances of ConstantQuantity are dependent 
on a UnitOfMeasure, while instances of FunctionQuantity are 
Functions that map instances of ConstantQuantity to other instances 
of ConstantQuantity (e.g., TimeDependentQuantities are 
FunctionQuantities).  Although the name and definition of 
PhysicalQuantity is borrowed from physics, PhysicalQuantities need 
not be material.  Aside from the dimensions of length, time, velocity, 
etc., nonphysical dimensions such as currency are also possible.  
Accordingly, amounts of money would be instances of PhysicalQuantity.  
PhysicalQuantities are distinguished from Numbers by the fact that 
the former are associated with a dimension of measurement.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Intuitively, the class of things that happen 
and have temporal parts or stages.  Examples include extended events 
like a football match or a race, actions like Pursuing and Reading, 
and biological processes. The formal definition is: anything that lasts 
for a time but is not an Object.  Note that a Process may have 
participants 'inside' it which are Objects, such as the players 
in a football match.  In a 4D ontology, a Process is something whose 
spatiotemporal extent is thought of as dividing into temporal stages 
roughly perpendicular to the time-axis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:Class rdf:ID= "Proposition">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource ="#Abstract"/>
<rdfs:comment>Propositions are Abstract entities that 
express a complete thought or a set of such thoughts.  As an example, 
the formula '(instance Yojo Cat)' expresses the Proposition that the 
entity named Yojo is an element of the Class of Cats.  Note that 
propositions are not restricted to the content expressed by individual 
sentences of a Language.  They may encompass the content expressed by 
theories, books, and even whole libraries.  It is important to distinguish 
Propositions from the ContentBearingObjects that express them.  A 
Proposition is a piece of information, e.g. that the cat is on the mat, 
but a ContentBearingObject is an Object that represents this information.  
A Proposition is an abstraction that may have multiple representations: 
strings, sounds, icons, etc.  For example, the Proposition that the cat is 
on the mat is represented here as a string of graphical characters displayed 
on a monitor and/or printed on paper, but it can be represented by a sequence 
of sounds or by some non-latin alphabet or by some cryptographic form</rdfs:comment>

This means that for all pairs of quantities ?QUANTITY1 and ?QUANTITY2, 
(lessThan ?QUANTITY1 ?QUANTITY2) if and only if, for some ?NUMBER1, 
?NUMBER2, and ?UNIT, ?QUANTITY1 = (MeasureFn ?NUMBER1 ?UNIT),

from Classes in two important respects.  First, Sets are extensional - 
two Sets with the same elements are identical.  Second, a Set can be 
an arbitrary stock of objects.  That is, there is no requirement that Sets 
have an associated condition that determines their membership.  Note that Sets 
are not assumed to be unique sets, i.e. elements of a Set may occur more 
than once in the Set.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>(refers ?OBJ1 ?OBJ2) means that ?OBJ1 
mentions or includes a reference to ?OBJ2. Note that refers is 
more general in meaning than represents, because presumably something

For example, an article whose topic is a recent change in the price of 
oil may refer to many other things, e.g. the general state of the economy, 
the weather in California, the prospect of global warming, the options 
for alternative energy sources, the stock prices of various oil companies,
